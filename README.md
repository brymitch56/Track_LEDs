Track LEDs

This is an arduino controlled project to run WS2811 LEDs mounted along the sides of a Pinewood Derby track. The goal is for the LEDs to randomize until the ready button is pressed, then go all yellow (or any other solid color) and wait for the gate to open. Upon gate opening, the LEDs will chase green down the track to the finish, light all green for a moment, then go back to the random loop.
